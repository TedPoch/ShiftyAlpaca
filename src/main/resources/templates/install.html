<h3>Push the button to install or re-install the SQL Analyzer to your workspace. The app should not
currently be 'distributed', meaning it can only be installed to the workspace if you are the one that
has created the app and relevant bot user or if you are someone that has been given admin permissions
to the same.</h3>
