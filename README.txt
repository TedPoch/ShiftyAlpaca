This project will serve as the basis for my Master's Capstone at the University of Utah's School of Computing. Our program has exposed us to a large variety of languages, frameworks, and design patterns. But more importantly, the program has emphasized methods that effective software developers use to learn new technologies quickly.

In that vein, I plan to use this project as a driver to independently learn new technologies and techniques. This will primarily involve teaching myself how to develop using the Java Spring framework, to include Hibernate/JPA, Spring Data, Spring Shell, and the Slack API. It will also require that I learn how to administer a Linux VM on Windows Azure, a Tomcat installation on that server, and Postman/ngrok as means to test the development of my application's API.

Lastly, while I will be working independently for the most part, I plan to put myself into an Agile mindset, using sprints and retrospections with the software manager I am working with at Adobe Systems.


Prototype & Plan - Weeks 1 - 3
	• Sketch out potential interface/architecture for discussion in initial meetings
	• Meet with DBAs
		○ doRequirements()
		○ schedFollowUp(1 weeks)
	• Meet with set of common users
		○ doRequirements()
		○ schedFollowUp(1 weeks)
	• Rank requirements; divide into 3 tasks; breakout into Sprints

Sprints Code/Test/Integrate/Document - Weeks 4 - 12
	• approximately 3 weeks per sprint
	• Week 1-2 Code
	• Week 2-3 Test/Integrate/Document
	• Weekly: meet with lead to review progress
	• Last day of each Sprint:
		○ meet with lead
		○ present finished task
			§ review & retrospective
	• Wash/Rinse/Repeat x3

Weeks 13 - 15 - Full production integration
	• If things go well, this could also be cushion and additional features time
